This project is created in order to show the distribution condition of House in Beijing area.
I will show some pictures by painting in the way of matplot and wordCloud in the wordCloudPic.py
as well as create eval.csv file which you can observe these index 
such as median,mean value,peak value and so on.

In the eval.csv,you can observe the index such as mean,standard deviation,coefficient of variation,median and so on.

In model_processing.py, I use some model SVM,RandomForest,AdaBoost in order to
compare their difference.As result,you can see these accuracy respectively.

When you run the analyse.py,this file will create regional distribution scale pictue.
in Beijing city and you can get there picture in current area.
